# Networking Azure Application Components

# Lab Answer Key: Deploying Network Infrastructure for Use in Azure Solutions

## Before we start

1. Ensure that you are logged in to your Windows 10 lab virtual machine using the following credentials:

    - Username: **Admin**

    - Password: **Pa55w.rd**

1. Review Taskbar located at the bottom of your Windows 10 desktop. The Taskbar contains the icons for the common applications you will use in the labs:

    - Microsoft Edge

    - File Explorer

    - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

    - [Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/storage-explorer/)

    - Bash on Ubuntu on Windows

    - Windows PowerShell

    > **Note**: You can also find shortcuts to these applications in the **Start Menu**.

## Exercise 1: Configure the lab environment

#### Task 1: Open the Azure Portal and Cloud Shell.

1. On the Taskbar, click the **Microsoft Edge** icon.

1. In the open browser window, navigate to the **Azure Portal** (<https://portal.azure.com>).

1. When prompted, authenticate with the user account account that has the owner role in the Azure subscription you will be using in this lab.

1. At the top of the portal, click the **Cloud Shell** icon to open a new shell instance.

    > **Note**: The **Cloud Shell** icon is a symbol that is constructed of the combination of the *greater than* and *underscore* characters.

1. If this is your first time opening the **Cloud Shell** using your subscription, you will see a wizard to configure **Cloud Shell** for first-time usage. When prompted, in the **Welcome to Azure Cloud Shell** pane, click **Bash (Linux)**.

    > **Note**: If you do not see the configuration options for **Cloud Shell**, this is most likely because you are using an existing subscription with this course's labs. If so, proceed directly to the next task.

1. In the **You have no storage mounted** pane, click **Show advanced settings**, perform the following tasks:

    - Leave the **Subscription** drop-down list entry set to its default value.

    - In the **Cloud Shell region** drop-down list, select the Azure region matching or near the location where you intend to deploy resources in this lab

    - In the **Resource group** section, select the **Create new** option and then, in the text box below, type **AADesignLab0801-RG**.

    - In the **Storage account** section, ensure that the **Create new** option is selected and then, in the text box below, type a unique name consisting of a combination of between 3 and 24 characters and digits.

    - In the **File share** section, ensure that the **Create new** option is selected and then, in the text box below, type **cloudshell**.

    - Click the **Create storage** button.

1. Wait for the **Cloud Shell** to finish its first-time setup procedures before you proceed to the next task.

#### Task 2: Deploy an Azure VM running Linux Ubuntu 18.04 that will be used to perform Azure Building Blocks-based deployments.

> **Note**: This is necessary to account for breaking changes affecting running from Cloud Shell.

1. At the **Cloud Shell** command prompt, run the following to create a variable which value designates the name of your Azure subscription:

1. At the **Cloud Shell** command prompt, run the following to create a variable which value designates the name of the resource group you will use in this exercise:

    ```sh
    RESOURCE_GROUP='AADesignLab0802-RG'
    ```

1. At the **Cloud Shell** command prompt, run the following to create a variable which value designates the Azure region you will use for the deployment (replace the `<location>` placeholder with the name of the Azure region you want to use in this lab):

    ```sh
    LOCATION='<location>'
    ```

1. At the **Cloud Shell** command prompt, run the following to create a resource group that you will use for the deployment:

    ```sh
    az group create --name $RESOURCE_GROUP --location $LOCATION
    ```

1. At the **Cloud Shell** command prompt, run the following to deploy an Azure VM running Linux Ubuntu 18.04 that you will use for deploying resources via Azure Building Blocks:

    ```sh
    UBUNTU_IMAGE='Canonical:UbuntuServer:18.04-LTS:latest'
    VM_NAME='lab08vm1'
    USER_NAME='student'

    --image $UBUNTU_IMAGE \
    --admin-username $USER_NAME \
    --generate-ssh-keys \
    --size Standard_DS1_v2
    ```

> **Note**: Wait until the deployment completes.

1. At the **Cloud Shell** command prompt, run the following to retrieve the public IP address of the newly deployed Azure VM **lab08vm1**:

    ```sh
    IP_ADDRESS=$(az vm show -d --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $VM_NAME --query publicIps -o tsv)
    ```

1. In the **Cloud Shell** pane, run the following to open an SSH session to the newly deployed Azure VM **lab08vm1**:
